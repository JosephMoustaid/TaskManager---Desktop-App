# Task Manager Application

## Overview

The **Task Manager Application** is a desktop application designed to help users manage their personal tasks efficiently. It provides features such as task creation, modification, deletion, and categorization based on priority, status, and deadlines. The application is built using **Java** and **JavaFX** for the user interface, with **PostgreSQL** as the backend database. It also includes features like user authentication, task filtering, and notifications.

This project was developed as part of an academic project at **Ecole Marocaine des Sciences de l'IngÃ©nieur (EMSI)** under the guidance of **Mme Bouchra HONNIT**.
